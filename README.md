Steps I used to create:
in command prompt run:

npx create-react-app becommerce

Then open in Visual Studio Code

To stand up this project:
make sure to run this in the terminal:

yarn install 

then run:
yarn add phosphor-react react-router-dom


if things get tangled up use:

yarn cache clean 

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules

and then:

yarn install
